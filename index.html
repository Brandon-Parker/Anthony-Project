        <font color = #de622c> Days 1-4: Beijing </font>
          <p><font color = #000>
              Beijing is the capital of China and in important hub of culture, art and higher education. Enjoy two packed days of activity in this city where you will visit the 500 year old Imperial Palace known as the Forbidden City, hike along one of the most well preserved sections of the Great Wall, and take the ride of your life as you “slide” down from the wall in a five minute toboggan ride through the forested hillside. You will also have time to wander the pleasant maze of narrow, pedestrian alleyways known as Hutongs where we’ll meet with a local family who will teach us to make dumplings and also with a local artisan to learn some ancient handicrafts.</font></p>

        <font color = #de622c> Days 5-6: Xi’an, Shaanxi Province</font>
					<p>Xi’an is just a short flight Southwest of Beijing toward China’s interior. One of the oldest cities in China, Xi’an has more than 3100 years of history and was one of the four Great Ancient Capitals. Xi’an is home to the Terracotta Army, an archaeological treasure of thousands of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of the first Emperor of China. A form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BC, the purpose of the army was to protect the emperor in his afterlife. Standing together in formation, the terracotta figures form an awe inspiring site. While in Xi’an we will also visit the Muslim quarter, a relic of China’s silk trade, and walk the Xi’an city wall, one of the most well preserved in the country.</p>

        <font color = #de622c>Day 6-7: Chengdu</font>
          <p>The capital of Sichuan Province, Chengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain. During our two days here, you will visit a dinosaur museum built on top of the world’s largest concentration of dinosaur bones, experience the Chinese dramatic art of “face- changing”, and visit a temple honoring the emperors of the three kingdom period.</p>

        <font color = #de622c>Day 8: Chengdu via Leshan, Sichuan Province</font>
					<p>From Chengdu, we will stop in Leshan to visit the giant Buddha statue, built in the Tang dynasty. (618–907AD). Towering over the confluence of three rivers, the Minjiang, Dadu and Quingyi, the stone sculpture is carved into the cliff face, and stands 233 feet tall. It is by far the largest Buddha in the world.</p>

        <font color = #de622c>Day 9: Dujiangyan Panda Center- Chengdu</font>
          <p>Today we volunteer to help the staff care for the Giant Pandas at the Dujiangyan Base Panda Keeper Program.  Activities include cleaning panda enclosures, preparing panda food, and planting bamboo and trees.</p>

        <font color = #de622c>Day 10: Chengdu – Maoxian</font>
					<p>After a morning orientation by Kanghua NGO about the project we will be helping with in Maoxian, we then proceed to drive to Maoxian County, an area that was badly impacted by the earthquake of 2008.   Upon arrival, we’ll tour the village and get acquainted with our local host families. During the homestay, part of our days will be spent with your host family helping in daily chores, tending animals, working fields, playing with the children or getting to know your family. Maoxian County is home to the largest number of Qiang minority people who were inhabitants of west China even in ancient times. Their activities were carved on tortoise shells, tracing back to as early as the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 B.C.). During the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), they began to migrate to other places and part of them came to Maoxian County. Maoxian is an also area that was badly impacted by the earthquake of 2008 and Kanghua has been helping them to rebuild the community by different methods.</p>

				<font color = #de622c>Day 11-12: Maoxian Volunteer Work and Homestay</font>
					<p>For these next two days, you will have the opportunity to live and work with your host family and participate in a community service project with local villagers. In an effort to help you learn what it means to be a local and understand the life of your family, we do not ask our hosts to do anything special for our stay.
